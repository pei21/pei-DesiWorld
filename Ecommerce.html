            <h3 class="project-title">What is the problems?</h3>
             <p>Users often ignored the product review form due to poor Layout issues, a lack of clear structure, and the absence of a submission confirmation. Additionally, the review section plays a crucial role for customers when they are deciding whether to purchase a product. Therefore, it must be user-friendly, make it easy to check credible feedback, and provide a simple way to rate the item. A well-designed review experience can increase trust and influence potential buyers who are considering making a purchase.</p>

            <h3 class="project-title">The Goal</h3>
             <p>This project focused on improving the entire review section of an e-commerce platform. The goal was to make the review process more engaging, increase the conversion rate, and facilitate users in sharing their thoughts through a simple UI design, while ensuring it seamlessly integrated with the existing platform and maintained brand consistency.</p>

             <h3 class="project-title">Competitor Analysis</h3>
              <p>I analyzed several competitor platforms with high review volumes to identify common strengths and weaknesses. Key factors included <strong>review volume</strong> (the number of reviews and engagement levels), <strong>user-friendly structure</strong> (how easily users could find key information such as overall rating and helpful reviews), and <strong>review presentation</strong> (how the reviews were displayed—star ratings, helpfulness, pros/cons). I discovered that many competitors had well-structured review sections and included <strong>visual guides</strong> that helped users quickly interpret the data, such as “80% of 1000 users recommend this product".</p>

            <h3 class="project-title">Survey Insights & User Behavior Analysis</h3>
             <p>I utilized surveys and other platforms to navigate user behavior and gain insights into pain points and expectations. Key findings included that <strong>users were overwhelmed</strong> by outdated long-form reviews and preferred <strong>concise summaries of the reviews</strong>. There was <strong>uncertainty</strong> about the meaning of the "overall rating," and users generally preferred a simple, <strong>interactive visual design</strong> where they could explore reviews in a <strong>more interactive way</strong></p>

            <div>
               <p>The <strong>current format</strong> was enhanced by simplifying the review summary and breaking down key information into easily digestible segments (e.g., “<strong>80% of 1000 users recommend this product</strong>”). This allowed users to <strong>quickly assess product reputation</strong> without being overwhelmed by lengthy content.</p>

        <h3 class="project-title">What have I completed</h3>
        <p>Reflecting on this project, the limited time to address the needs of three target audiences—students, learning advisors, and hiring managers—pushed us to prioritize and focus on the student and hiring manager. After discussions, we decided to move forward with these two key user groups. It was a rewarding journey to break down each step, from identifying the problems to developing solutions. I learned a lot from my peers and continuously worked to improve the website, ensuring it better meets the needs of all users</p>
