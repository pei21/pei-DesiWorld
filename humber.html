After navigating the site, I quickly realized that it wasn't immediately clear where to find events. This observation led me to identify several areas that could be improved. By addressing these issues, the website could offer a more user-friendly experience, making it easier for future students to connect and register for events, as well as helping hiring managers find and engage with candidates more efficiently.</p>

                After gathering feedback and iterating on the project, we were able to successfully launch the redesigned website. This video showcases how a student can easily register for an event by scrolling through the event page, viewing event details including time and date, and adding it to their calendar for reminders about the upcoming event. </p>

        <p>Reflecting on this project, the limited time to address the needs of three target audiences—students, learning advisors, and hiring managers—pushed us to prioritize and focus on the student and hiring manager. After discussions, we decided to move forward with these two key user groups. It was a rewarding journey to break down each step, from identifying the problems to developing solutions. I learned a lot from my peers and continuously worked to improve the website, ensuring it better meets the needs of all users</p>
