          <p class="intro-paragraph">During my academic pursuit, I had the opportunity to explore the Humber College website. After navigating the site, I quickly realized that it wasn't immediately clear where to find events. This observation led me to identify several areas that could be improved. By addressing these issues, the website could offer a more user-friendly experience, making it easier for future students to connect and register for events, as well as helping hiring managers find and engage with candidates more efficiently.</p>

              <p>The reason for creating two personas is that this platform is aimed at serving different types of users. Sarah is a Media Arts student eager to launch her career, seeking job opportunities that align with her passion and skills in the creative industry. Jason is a busy hiring manager in the Digital Technology department, looking to quickly find the right candidate for his team and efficiently reach out to potential hires. Both personas highlight the need for a streamlined platform that connects students with relevant opportunities and simplifies the recruitment process for hiring managers.</p>

             <p>An empathy map helps me analyze user behavior by focusing on what they do, think, say, and feel. It provides a deeper understanding of their needs, frustrations, and motivations. By gathering these insights, I can accurately identify students' pain points and create solutions that reduce the time hiring managers spend searching for candidates.</p>

        <p>Reflecting on this project, the limited time to address the needs of three target audiences—students, learning advisors, and hiring managers—pushed us to prioritize and focus on the student and hiring manager. After discussions, we decided to move forward with these two key user groups. It was a rewarding journey to break down each step, from identifying the problems to developing solutions. I learned a lot from my peers and continuously worked to improve the website, ensuring it better meets the needs of all users</p>
