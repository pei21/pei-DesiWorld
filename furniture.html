The updated interface navigation, and cohesive visual style could lead to an estimated 10–15% rise in conversion rates among users who explore product collections or complete a purchase. Additionally, by minimizing friction throughout the browsing and checkout process, the improved design may help reduce bounce rates on key product pages and enhance the overall in-app experience.</p>

              What I learned
         </h3>
         <P>Throughout this process, we faced challenges in integrating 3D elements into the app design, which required careful planning and execution. Thankfully, with the help of my team, we were able to collaborate and create initial sketches that served as the foundation for presenting the 3D concepts. We discussed various ways to effectively incorporate these elements into the app interface, considering both user experience and technical constraints. By maintaining open communication and working together, we successfully met our deadlines. Additionally, we gathered valuable feedback from both peers and professionals, which played a crucial role in refining the design and ensuring the solution was both functional and user-friendly.</P>
         <p>On a personal level, this project has significantly enhanced my ability to communicate effectively within a team. I learned how to articulate my ideas clearly and share potential solutions, which was especially important when tackling complex challenges. For example, I suggested creating a specific category to streamline the shipping process, which ultimately reduced time and improved efficiency. This experience has strengthened my confidence in conveying my plans and collaborating with others to arrive at the best possible outcomes. It also taught me the importance of being proactive in sharing ideas and listening to feedback, which has been invaluable for my professional growth.</p>
