Additionally, I developed personas, journey maps, and user flows to ensure that the new feature stood out and effectively appealed to potential buyers.</p>

            <p>Michelle’s journey to purchasing furniture begins when she decides to explore her options through a mobile app. She starts by downloading the app, and as she browses through various furniture options, she encounters both positive and negative experiences, such as an overwhelming number of choices without clear filters. Once she adds items to her cart, she proceeds to checkout but faces some frustration with the payment process, particularly issues with her card being declined. This moment could be improved by offering a more intuitive payment experience. After successful payment, she receives confirmation and delivery options, but is confused by the variety of delivery choices available. By identifying these touch points, we can focus on improving her experience, especially with payment, by making it smoother and more reliable.</p>

              What I learned
         </h3>
         <P>Throughout this process, we faced challenges in integrating 3D elements into the app design, which required careful planning and execution. Thankfully, with the help of my team, we were able to collaborate and create initial sketches that served as the foundation for presenting the 3D concepts. We discussed various ways to effectively incorporate these elements into the app interface, considering both user experience and technical constraints. By maintaining open communication and working together, we successfully met our deadlines. Additionally, we gathered valuable feedback from both peers and professionals, which played a crucial role in refining the design and ensuring the solution was both functional and user-friendly.</P>
         <p>On a personal level, this project has significantly enhanced my ability to communicate effectively within a team. I learned how to articulate my ideas clearly and share potential solutions, which was especially important when tackling complex challenges. For example, I suggested creating a specific category to streamline the shipping process, which ultimately reduced time and improved efficiency. This experience has strengthened my confidence in conveying my plans and collaborating with others to arrive at the best possible outcomes. It also taught me the importance of being proactive in sharing ideas and listening to feedback, which has been invaluable for my professional growth.</p>
